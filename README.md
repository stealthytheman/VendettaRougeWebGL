## Things to know ðŸ‘€

This game was mad in under 27 hours for ACL Hacks 2025, expect bugs, ways to break it, and other various issues could arise. I hope you enjoy the game nonetheless!

### Room 1
â€”Donâ€™t click the bed until youâ€™ve clicked all of the other stuff including the door. When HIDE comes up you can click the bed. (This avoids breaking it lol)

### Room 2
â€”Click everything but the window first. After the dialogue you can click the window when HIDE shows up. 
â€” Sometimes you have to click the art twice to get it to show up. (Itâ€™s so dumb ik)

### Room2.5 & 3
â€” Nothing to know they work as intended

### Minigame Help (if needed)
â€”Clicking when the numbers are not on the center is a miss
â€”You can only miss like 3 or else you wonâ€™t make the quota and have to restart the minigame.
